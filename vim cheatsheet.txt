The :substitute command searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string. 

:%s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
:s/foo/bar/g
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.
:%s/foo/bar/gc
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.
:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
:%s/foo/bar/gci
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default).
:%s/foo/bar/gcI
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation.
This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive.
